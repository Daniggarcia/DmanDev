# GISMA Business School

During my tenure at Global University System, I was involved in the development and ongoing enhancement of the website for **GISMA Business School**.

## Project Overview

The GISMA Business School website serves as a central platform for prospective students, offering comprehensive information about the institution’s programs, admissions, and campus life. The site is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring it meets the needs of an international audience.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **TYPO3 CMS**: The website is built on TYPO3, chosen for its robust capabilities in managing large-scale, multilingual websites.
- **JavaScript & React**: These technologies were used to enhance interactivity and provide a dynamic user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the website is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the primary challenges was to ensure the website could handle the diverse needs of a global student body while maintaining high performance and accessibility standards. This was achieved by optimizing the website’s structure and implementing best practices in SEO to improve visibility in search engines.

Moreover, integrating features like online application forms and real-time chat support helped enhance the user experience, making it easier for prospective students to engage with the institution.

## Outcome

The GISMA Business School website successfully supports the institution's mission of providing world-class business education. It has become a central hub for students from around the world to explore educational opportunities at GISMA.
