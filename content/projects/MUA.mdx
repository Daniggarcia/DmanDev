## Project Overview

The MUA website serves as a crucial digital platform for prospective and current students, providing comprehensive information about the institution’s programs, admissions, and student life. The development of this site focused on delivering a seamless user experience with robust backend support.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **Next.js**: The website is built on Next.js (version 13.5.6), leveraging its server-side rendering and static site generation capabilities to deliver fast and SEO-friendly content.
- **React**: React is used extensively for building the interactive and dynamic user interface, ensuring a responsive and engaging experience across all devices.
- **Node.js**: The backend is powered by Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient environment for running the server-side code.
- **Nginx**: Nginx is used as the web server and reverse proxy, ensuring the website's reliability and performance under high traffic conditions.
- **Salesforce Service Cloud**: Integrated for managing customer relationships and providing support through live chat and other customer service tools.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the primary challenges was integrating multiple analytics and marketing tools while maintaining the website’s performance. This was achieved by carefully managing third-party scripts and using tag management systems like Google Tag Manager to optimize loading times.

Additionally, ensuring that the website was accessible and responsive across different devices was a key focus. The use of **Radix UI** and **lit-html** helped in building a consistent and accessible user interface.

## Outcome

The MUA website successfully supports the institution's mission by providing a reliable, informative, and engaging platform for students and staff. The integration of modern web technologies and tools has resulted in a website that is not only functional but also scalable and ready for future enhancements.
