# LSBF London School of Business & Finance

During my time at Global University System, I was part of the team responsible for developing and maintaining the website for the **London School of Business & Finance (LSBF)**. This project was built using **Umbraco**, a popular content management system based on **ASP.NET**.

## Project Overview

The LSBF website serves as a primary online presence for the institution, offering information on courses, admissions, and student resources. The website needed to be dynamic, user-friendly, and capable of handling a large volume of traffic from prospective students around the world.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **Umbraco CMS**: Utilized for content management, enabling the LSBF team to easily update and manage the website content.
- **ASP.NET**: Provided a robust and secure framework for the backend development.
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**: Frontend technologies used to create a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the major challenges was ensuring that the website could handle a large number of concurrent users, especially during peak periods such as admission deadlines. We optimized the backend and frontend to ensure fast load times and a seamless user experience.

Additionally, we implemented a content delivery network (CDN) to serve static assets, further improving the website's performance and reliability.

## Outcome

The LSBF website successfully supported the institution's digital presence, providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for students and staff alike. The project was delivered on time and met all the key performance indicators set by the Global University System.
