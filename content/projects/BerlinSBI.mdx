# Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BerlinSBI)

During my time at Global University System, I was involved in the development and ongoing maintenance of the website for the **Berlin School of Business and Innovation (BerlinSBI)**. The website plays a crucial role in supporting the institution's mission by providing a comprehensive digital platform for prospective and current students.

## Project Overview

The BerlinSBI website serves as a central hub for information on academic programs, admissions, and student services. The site is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring easy navigation and access to essential resources for a diverse international audience.

### Key Technologies Used:
- **WordPress CMS**: The website is built on WordPress, a flexible and widely-used content management system, allowing for easy content updates and management by the BerlinSBI team.
- **JavaScript & React**: To enhance interactivity and user experience, modern JavaScript frameworks like React are integrated into the website.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured that the website is fully responsive, offering a seamless experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Challenges & Solutions

One of the primary challenges was ensuring that the website could effectively communicate with an international audience, particularly in terms of language support and content accessibility. This was addressed by implementing multilingual capabilities and optimizing the user interface to be intuitive for non-native English speakers.

Additionally, given BerlinSBI's growing reputation, it was essential to maintain a robust infrastructure capable of handling increased traffic, especially during peak admissions periods. This involved optimizing the website's performance and leveraging cloud-based hosting solutions for scalability.

## Outcome

The BerlinSBI website effectively supports the institution's educational goals by providing a reliable, informative, and engaging online presence. The project was successful in delivering a platform that meets the needs of both the institution and its international student body.
